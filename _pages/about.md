Hi there! I am currently a master student in Cosmology at Beijing Normal university, and expected to graduate in June 2025. I work under the supervision of [Prof.Xia](https://physicsfaculty.bnu.edu.cn/teacher/247/index.html). And my research topic is the large-scale structure of the universe, especially using Fast Radio Bursts and galaxy suvey to measure the cosmic growth rate, which is based on the RSD(Redshiftt-space distortions) and kSZ(kinetic Sunyaevâ€“Zeldovich) effect. However, this work focuses on theorical forecasts, and I prefer to analyze data from different galaxy surveys in the future work. My research interests are kSZ effect, the history of reionization, and non-standard cosmological models. I am currently seeking for a PhD opportunity.

In my spare time, I enjoy going hiking, playing badminton, and reading books, and I am learning tennis recently.
